              <strong>The City of Dreams</strong> was founded in the 1990s by visionary
              industrialist <strong>Richard Night</strong>. When the world of
              late 20th century plunged into chaos, Night envisioned a modern
              metropolis free from crime, poverty and corruption. Corporate
              partners Arasaka, EBM, and Petrochem helped him realize this
              vision, investing in the foundation of what would become the Free
              City of Night City. The city would develop into a haven for young
              idealists and a beacon for others who sought to fulfill their own
              dreams. And although Richard fell to assassins and many new
              generations seeking fame, fortune and freedom have suffered their
              own series of setbacks, the city's legendary status endures today.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Night City</strong> has wide streets and dense urban skyscrapers which are
              home to millions of residents. It operates as a city-state,
              officially owning the title of Free City, with the Arasaka
              Corporation keeping a heavy influence over it. The metropolis is
              considered a thrilling and exciting location to visit, as well as
              an interesting and vibrant place to live for those of means, and a
              hellscape to the city's disenfranchised. Its world famous slogan
              is "The City of Dreams", originally changed from "City on the Edge
              of Tomorrow." In 2077.

              After the Time of the Red and the Unification War, Night City was
              mostly rebuilt and had maintain its autonomy.The city was divided
              into six districts — each with their own environment and denizens
              — and 16 official sub-districts. The total size of the city was
              around 75.42 km².

                        vacation resort, but once the investment dried up it
                        became a husk left to rot. Now, instead of tourists, the
                        district is overrun by gangs and violence, with The
                        Voodoo Boys protecting the community forsaken by NCPD.

                        Corporations use it as a testing ground for industrial

              <h2>Climate</h2>
              <p>
                Night City's Northern Californian location gives it one of the
                most pleasant climates in the Western part of the NUSA. Normal
                temperatures range from the mid 80°F to low 50°F (26°C to 10°C),
                with misty white fog blanketing the City in the early mornings
                and evenings. Night City receives around 21 inches of rainfall
                each year. Of this water that drops, around 35% contains toxic
                chemicals which is higher than the current government standards
                for the United States produced vehicles, clothing, and food. On
                average, if a person's vehicle and clothing are rated above SP
                12, adverse effects (staining and ablation) will be negligible.
              </p>
              <p>
                When one visits Night City, they should wear light to medium
                weight clothing, with an optional light armor jacket or
                ballistic-cloth overcoat. A filter mask and supplemental oxygen,
                hedges against inversion smog and acid rain fog, are highly
                recommended as well. That being said, acid-proof slickers,
                umbrellas, and air masks are readily available from the sidewalk
                vendors or smaller street stores during smog warning periods.
                The average cost of these items can range from €$20 to €$35.

            <article id="business-sector">
              <p>
                The business sectors of Night City include manufacturing
                industries, international trade and commerce, information
                services, electronic technologies, security services, and so on.
                While cities like Tokyo, New York or Singapore have been overrun
                by corporations by the 2000s, Night City was the only city in
                the world that was built by the corporations. Some of the
                biggest megacorporations in the world contributed to the
                construction of the city and many were located in the Corporate
                Center in 2020. After the war, and the subsequent reconstruction
                of Night City, Corpo Plaza became a symbol of the megacorps'
                grasp on the city.

                Night City was founded through the efforts of a partnership of
                five major corporations, and as of 2077 it continues to serve as
                a haven for numerous global corporations due to its status as a
                free city and pro-corporate government policies such as a 0.7%
                tax rate on corporate profits.Night City's biggest ally is
                Arasaka, which provides employment for many citizens and ensures
                the city remains independent by backing it with its military
                strength.

          <div style="max-height: 400px; overflow: auto">
            <p>
              The Arasaka Corporation is the longest-operating megacorp in the
              world. Its origins date back to the mid-20th century when a young
              Saburo Arasaka inherited his father's nascent company,
              transforming it into a global leader in security. Today, the
              Arasaka Corporation is known as an arms-manufacturing giant that
              has had its hands in military conflicts across all continents. Due
              to the latest advances in technology and the company's seemingly
              unlimited capital, Arasaka is poised to achieve its political
              goals on a massive scale. Arasaka's soldiers and agents are known
              not only for their excellent training, but also for their
              steadfast loyalty to corporate values and CEO Saburo Arasaka
              himself, who, despite his advancing age, continues to govern the
              corporation with an iron fist. Even discussions of a succession
              plan must be kept to a whisper, because no one would dare openly
              question the authority of the world's greatest weapons empire...
              Almost no one.

            <p>
              Militech International Armaments is one of the largest, most
              powerful corporations in the world. Known mainly in the NUSA for
              their support of the federal government, they provide both
              manpower and arms to the regime, including weapons and specialist
              military gear. Militech's contract for the NUSA is controversial
              in some political circles: Militech has been accused of attempting
              to create a monopoly, while the clear connections between former
              Militech CEO and current NUSA president Rosalind Myers and the
              corporation's board have only exacerbated corporate and diplomatic
              tensions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Militech also operates in the private sector, providing security
              as well as defensive and offensive combat services. The
              corporation offers clients the latest equipment, skilled staff and
              trained, well-equipped agents to get the job done. In addition,
              the megacorp also develops and produces its own firearms, drones,
              implants, even vehicles suitable for land, air and sea combat.

              EBM's power and stature afforded access to the highest levels of

              research and training facility hidden in the Alps. EBM also
              maintained a small orbital research facility with about thirty
              researchers and ten soldiers.

          <div style="max-height: 400px; overflow: auto">
            <p>
              If there's one thing Night Corp is known for, it's secrecy nobody
              really knows how much the corporation is worth, what its main
              source of revenue is, nor how many people it employs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The corporation is part Richard Night's legacy, the visionary
              industrialist who laid the bedrock of Night City. It was founded
              by Night's widow, Miriam, who used the money her late husband left
              behind to build it from the ground up and structure it around
              Night's ideals and principles . For many years, Miriam was the CEO
              of Night Corp before the helm was taken over by much less
              competent figures, who ultimately lost the race with Arasaka and
              Militech both of whom ultimately came to wield the most power in
              Night City. Now, Night Corp's glory days are long behind it. After
              years of progressive degeneration, Night Corp's influence waned to
              nearly non-existent. Still, outside of managing its own capital,
              Night's successors have maintained a significant say in matters
              pertaining to public administration and pro-social causes. Public
              road works, construction and conserving institutions for the
              public good, revitalizing the Maglev system these are only a
              handful of projects financed by Night Corp.
            </p>
            <p>
              More well-known beneficiaries include the NCPD and MaxTac, which
              are still partly financed by the Night Corp's shrinking coffers.
              It seems there are still those in the company's rather mysterious
              structure who have not lost faith in the vision of the city's
              founder. Even if cheapened by corporate slogans and guided
              primarily by politcal interests, the merits of Night Corp's role
              in the Free City's history cannot be diminished. In fact, with
              this in mind, some residents have expressed they wish for the day
              Night Corp returns to a position of true power.

              "Our planet's moving forward thanks to Petrochem" that commercial
              slogan is only half exaggerated. Thanks to its partnership with
              the bioengineering corporation Biotechnica, Petrochem converts
              genetically modified wheat grown on Biotechnica's millions of
              acres of farmland into the biofuel of the future – CHOOH2. In
              addition, it also has limited rights to grow its own modified
              grain. That means nobody can entirely avoid Petrochem – though
              while their influence and resources shouldn't be overstated, their
              competitors are fully aware of Petrochem's economic and political
              power. If the megacorporation were able to monopolize fuel
              production in the country, Petrochem would call the shots on
              everything. That's why the corp doesn't skimp on its security,
              hiring the best industry counterintel specialists and always
              stationed on high alert an attack could come from anywhere and at
              anytime.

              investors. Those same investors pulled out every last enny after
              the Unification War broke out, fearing yet another inter-corporate
              conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pacifica was abandoned by all but the local Haitian community, led
              by a gang of netrunners called the Voodoo Boys. The city has
              repeatedly tried and failed to bring the district back into the
              fold, but it remains isolated, with its own rules, language,
              manufactured goods (illegal in Night City) and independent Net.
              You could say that that Pacifica has blossomed under the Voodoo
              Boys' leadership, but poison oak would be a more suitable
              metaphor. To anyone who enters - beware.

              Heywood is a neighborhood of contrast—from modern skyscrapers and
              parks in the north, to dangerous, inhospitable slums in the south.
              It's <i>"the biggest bedroom in Night City"</i>, where many gangs
              get down to business—legal and illegal alike.

              Heywood is a district of contradictions. The northern part that
              borders the City Center is modern and well-kept, proud of its
              stunning megabuildings, parks, and places that are open to the
              public. But all you have to is go a few blocks southeast and the
              scenery starts to change dramatically. This part of Heywood is
              much poorer and more dangerous. The buildings are smaller and the
              streets are controlled by the Valentinos and the 6th Street Gang.
              If you know your place and keep your head down, Heywood isn't
              really so bad. After all, it's where most of Night City sleeps. If
              you're not a corpo and you score an apartment in the richer part
              of the district, then you've just won the lottery. Otherwise, just
              be happy you live in Heywood. In Night City, things could always
              be worse.

              Santo Domingo is one of Night City's oldest districts.
              Corporations use it as a testing ground for industrial projects,
              destroying old factories just to build new ones, while residents
              scrape a desperate living in crowded megabuildings — wishing for
              something better.

              Santo Domingo is one of Night City's oldest districts. Luckily,
              its location meant it avoided the worst damage from the 4th
              Corporate War, though the tens of thousands of Night Citizens
              deprived of their homes still built provisional camps and
              settlements. Today, no trace of them remains - Santo Domingo has
              instead become an industrial hub with an abundance of enterprises
              and manufacturing and power plants. Corporations are in constant
              battle over influence in the district - real estate changes hands,
              new businesses pop up and old businesses fall. Meanwhile,
              construction sites are guarded by combat troops guarding corporate
              property and secrets, though often they serve as law enforcement
              in cases when a company shuts down and fires all its staff (mostly
              around Rancho Coronado), raising the risk of riots.

              Today, Watson is a sad and desperate place. It's one of Night
              City's poorest districts and it's a battleground between Maelstrom
              and Tyger Claws.

            <p>
              Watson was supposed to be the beating heart of Night City. A few
              decades ago, Japanese zaibatsus invested billions of eurodollars
              in skyscrapers, nightclubs, the Med Center, even industry in the
              northern area - all intended to make the district self-sufficient
              and prosperous. But everything changed when Arasaka returned to
              the city after the Unification War. The corporation steamrolled
              all of its competitors, and without a stable financial sector,
              Watson caved in on itself. Jobs in the Northside Industrial
              District completely evaporated, leaving people out on the street,
              allowing Arasaka to buy up all the now-cheap real estate. Turns
              out, the move was calculated: Arasaka needed port-access. Today
              Watson is one of Night City's poorest districts, inhabited mainly
              by workers in Northside earning ennies.

              Westbrook is considered by many to be the best place to live and
              have fun in Night City. If you've got eddies, you come here to
              spend them. And if you don't? Well, take out a loan and pretend
              you're on top of the world — even for just one glorious night.

          <h2>WESTBROOK</h2>
          <div style="max-height: 400px; overflow: auto">
            <p>
              A fair amount of Night Citizens firmly believe that Westbrook is
              the best district to live in. After all, that's where all the
              richest and most influential people of Night City live, including
              the picturesquely situated North Oak - probably the most beautiful
              neighborhood in the city. Charter Hill has its charm, too - home
              to ambitious and enterprising corpos who are about halfway up
              their career ladder. Last but not least, Japantown is widely known
              as Night City's party district. Yes indeed, Westbrook is where
              everyone wants to be. But it wasn't always like that. Over fifty
              years ago, after the nuclear attack on Arasaka in 2023, the part
              of Westbrook next to City Center sustained serious damage. The
              bomb's earthquake completely wiped out Japantown's high-rises,
              leaving behind ghostly, crooked skeletons looming over the
              district for the next two decades. Charter Hill was inundated with
              refugees - even North Oak saw ramshackle huts and tents hastily
              put up on its slopes. Luckily, by the 40s, the great restoration
              of Night City was already underway - the ruins of megabuildings
              were removed, replaced by shiny monoliths from predominantly Asian
              corporations, returning Japantown to its former glory. Charter
              Hill was also cleaned up and soon saw new homes for corpo
              employees. The refugee and homeless encampments in North Oak
              lasted for much longer, remaining a sore sight for the city's
              authorities. Crime levels there beat the city's records - for a
              time even soaring above those of the Combat Zone. Eventually the
              area was brought to order with the help of mercenaries, and
              shortly after it became the North Oak we know today - the most
              exclusive and secure area of Night City.
